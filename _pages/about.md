I'm a final year Masters in Computer Science student at the <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/" style="color: currentColor;"><b>Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University</b></a>. I'm also engaged in AI research with the [Machine Learning for Good Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/ml4good/), advised by Professor <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/~neill/" style="color: currentColor;"><b>Daniel Neill</b></a>, and the [Open Networks and Big Data Lab](https://nyunetworks.github.io/), advised by Professor <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/~lakshmi/Lakshmi/Home.html" style="color: currentColor;"><b>Lakshmi Subramanian</b></a>.

If you're an incoming student at NYU, or would like to chat in general about research and beyond, please feel free to reach out to me via email or one of my links below.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I'm a final year Masters in Computer Science student at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University. I'm currently working with the Machine Learning for Good Lab, advised by Professor [Daniel Neill](https://cs.nyu.edu/~neill/), and the Open Networks and Big Data Lab, advised by Professor [Lakshmi Subramanian](https://cs.nyu.edu/~lakshmi/Lakshmi/Home.html).

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
